This is the my Classic Arcade Project for Udacity Nanodegree

## Installation

To download the game use Git or checkout with SVN using this web URL:  https://github.com/Pfefferminzo/Classic-Arcade.git
If you want to start the game just open the index.html and the game will start directly in the browser

## Instructions

Your goal is to reach the waterside (top) of the game board. The bugs are your enemies and you will have to avoid touching them
If you are touched by a bug the game will reset and your player will be moved to the starting position

If you reach the goal a button will appear and you can reset the whole game to play again.

Your player can move up,down,left and right.
